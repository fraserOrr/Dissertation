# Dissertation
This was my final year project titles Secure Smart Grid Application 

Abstract "  
This project will aim to investigate the communication between Intelligent Electronic 
Devices (IEDs) alongside the security risks associated with them and finally the 
infrastructure in which they are used. Through research and testing, a prototype will be 
created to model the proposed encryption solutions for various communication types found 
in a smart grid system. The challenge of this project is to find an elegant solution that will 
provide security without hindering the operation of the smart grid.
